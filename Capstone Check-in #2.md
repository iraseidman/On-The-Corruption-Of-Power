 On The Corruption Of Power - An Analysis Of How Centralizaing Power May Lead To Unpopular/Ineffective Laws In The US And Abroad
This is the notebook for my General Assembly Data Science Immersive capstone project. Here I will outline the goals and intent for the project. Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, modeling, and predictions will all be done in seperate notebooks. Please see my outline below:
1. Final topic proposal - I will collect data that both quantifies the extent to which power in a state/country is centralized and helps quantify to what extent laws and policy are popular/effective. Features used to quantify centralized power will ideally include:
- The number of representatives in a jurisdiction (a count of one would represent an absolute monarch and if everyone in the jurisdiction was able to participate it would be a pure direct democracy)
- The number of viable parties
- Whether elections are held or not
- The percent of public eligible to vote
- The number/frequency of referendums
The targets will be whether a certain law exists (for example - is marijuana legal?). Additional features will include gallop polls and pertinent outcomes data. For example, if 70% of people in New York want marijuana to be legalized and states that have recreational marijuana have better health outcomes, will the law be passed or not passed given the government's structure? *The problem statement - is there a correlation between government structure and the extent to which laws are popular and/or effective? If so, how accurately can laws be predicted given structural data about a government along with polling/outcomes data?*
2. The main goal of the project is to determine whether if more people are involved in the political process are governments more likely to pass popular laws/laws that lead to better outcomes? In the case of legalizing marijuana, how do healthspans in states with legalization compare to states with prohibition? Colloquially, this looks to explore to what extent centralizing power will lead to corruption? Corruption is being defined in one of two ways - poor public approval and/or ineffective outcomes that are demonstably not in the public's best interest.
3. My proposed methods will be to collect as much data as I can that describes the structure of a government. This data will span as many countries and US states as possible. I will then model how these characterstics can be used in conjunction with polls to predict state law. If the model can reliably use government structure to predict whether laws are in line or not in line with public approval it my be able to show what the best predictors of corruption are and help understand the solutions better. Other polling data on issues including but not limited to gay marriage, universal basic income, universal healthcare, and military intervention would also be interesting to test against corruption indices.
4. The major risks of this project is that a lot of the data could be self-reported by states and countries that are trying to hide corruption so it might make findings more difficult to uncover. Certain polling data may also be tough to find. The main assumptions about the data is that gallop polls are representative samples for the areas being reported on.
